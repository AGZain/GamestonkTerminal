## About The Project

How it started:
"Gamestonk Terminal is an awesome stock and crypto market terminal that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking. But hey, I like the stock üíéüôå."

How it's going:
u/schoen: _(...) I think people have upvoted this so much because it's an initial version of a single person's passion project that manages to put a whole bunch of financial information at your fingertips. With an active community, it could easily grow and grow and grow in functionality._


## Getting Started
### Install

Supported Python versions: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Confirm that you have it with: `conda -V`
The output should be like `conda 4.9.2`

2. Create Environment

You can name the environment whatever you want. Although you could use names such as: `welikethestock`, `thisistheway` or `diamondhands`, we recommend something simple and intuitive like `gst`. This is because this name will be used from now onwards.
```
conda create -n gst python=3.6.8
````

3. Fork the Project

- Via HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal.git`
- via SSH:  `git clone git@github.com:DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal.git`

4. Install packages

For this you'll need to activate your conda's environment with:
`conda activate gst`.
Note: At the end, all is needed is `conda deactivate`

Navigate into the "GamestonkTerminal" folder.

Regardless of the method you select to install all the necessary packages, it will take some time. Thus, grab a coke whilst it runs.

* Use Poetry for package management: `poetry install`
* Be brave - use pure pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go with docker: `docker build .`

PS: The problem with docker is that it won't output matplotlib figures.

5. Possible errors

If fbprophet gives issues, try:
 `conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet -y`

6. You're ready to Gamestonk it!
* With Poetry: `poetry run python gamestonk_terminal.py`
* Hardcore: `python gamestonk_terminal.py`
* With docker: `docker run -it gamestonkterminal:dev `

### API Keys

The project is build around several different API calls, whether it is to access historical data or financials.

These are the ones where a key is necessary:
  * Alpha Vantage: https://www.alphavantage.co
  * Financial Modeling Prep: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer
  * Quandl: https://www.quandl.com/tools/api
  * Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
  * Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com

When these are obtained, don't forget to update [config_terminal.py](/config_terminal.py).  Alternatively, you can also set them to the following environment variables:
  * GT_API_KEY_ALPHAVANTAGE
  * GT_API_KEY_FINANCIALMODELINGPREP
  * GT_API_KEY_QUANDL
  * GT_API_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
  * GT_API_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
  * GT_API_REDDIT_USERNAME
  * GT_API_REDDIT_USER_AGENT
  * GT_API_REDDIT_PASSWORD
  * GT_API_TWITTER_KEY
  * GT_API_TWITTER_SECRET_KEY
  * GT_API_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN.

Note that it is not necessary to have a valid Alpha Vantage key to get daily OHLC values.

### Usage

Start by loading a ticker of interest:
```
load -t GME
```
The menu will expand to all its menus since a ticker has been loaded.

View the historical data of this stock:
```
view
```
Apply some technical indicators to the ticker, starting at 2020-06-04.
Re-load ticker with starting time, this time:
```
load -t GME -s 2020-06-04
```
Enter in technical analysis menu with
```
ta
```
and run a SMA with:
```
sma
```
However, imagine that you wanted to change the length of the window because you don't want to go long but do a swing, and therefore a smaller window is necessary. Check what settings are available on the SMA command:
```
sma -h
```
Once that has been seen, set the parameters that you want after flagging them. In this case, to change length window to 10, we would have to do:
```
sma -l 10
```
